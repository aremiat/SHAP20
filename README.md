Green Finance Portfolio Analysis Project
Overview

The SHPA 20 portfolio is built on a quantitative, ESG-driven investment approach that balances financial performance with environmental responsibility. The goal is to compare this portfolio against the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index to assess whether a green-focused investment strategy can deliver competitive returns while maintaining sustainability standards.

The selection process begins with financial screening, ensuring that only companies with strong long-term performance are considered. Metrics such as the 20-year annualized return and the 20-year Sharpe ratio are used to evaluate financial stability. Companies with poor financial performance or unsustainable returns are excluded to maintain a robust investment base.

Once financial strength is established, environmental filters are applied to align the portfolio with climate transition goals. Companies must have an Intensity of Temperature Rise (ITR) below 2.5°C, ensuring compliance with global climate commitments. Additionally, firms must achieve an ODD 7 score of at least 2, reflecting their commitment to sustainable energy practices. This dual filtering approach refines an initial pool of 1,247 assets down to 291 investable companies that meet both financial and environmental criteria.

Following the selection process, companies are assigned a financial score based on their long-term performance. These scores are then normalized to maintain consistency across all assets, with higher scores indicating stronger financial health. The portfolio is constructed by selecting 20 high-performing assets, ensuring an optimal balance between diversification and performance.

Weighting within the portfolio is determined by financial scores, with higher-scoring companies receiving greater allocations. Sustainability compliance remains a key priority, with continuous monitoring to ensure the portfolio’s average ITR remains below 2°C. If the threshold is breached, adjustments are made by recalibrating weights to maintain alignment with climate goals.

The final SHPA 20 portfolio consists of 20 carefully selected assets, offering both strong financial returns and a commitment to sustainable investing. By integrating rigorous financial and environmental screening, this strategy aims to outperform traditional low-carbon benchmarks while promoting long-term value creation in a rapidly evolving economic and regulatory landscape.
