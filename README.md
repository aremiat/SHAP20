Green Finance Portfolio Analysis Project
Overview

This project aims to analyze and compare the performance of the SHAP 20 portfolio, an ESG-Driven quantitative portfolio that we created and the MSCI ACWI Low Carbon Target Index.
We explore how a green-focused investment strategy (SHAP 20) fares against a widely followed low-carbon index, providing insights into their annualized returns, cumulative performance, and assessing possible biases, such as survivorship bias.
